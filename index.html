                            <li>

                                    <b>A group stage,</b> where participants are split into groups of 5*. The groups will be
                                    chosen by me. I will put my best efforts to place a mix of players at different skill
                                    levels in each group, and to split up players of the same skill level. Each group and
                                    it's players will be put in a table. Participants in each group will play each other
                                    EXACTLY once, first to 10. where a win awards 3 points, and a loss awards 1 point. When
                                    all players have played each of their matches, the top two* players with the most points
                                    will qualify to play in the second stage. </p>

                                be double elimination. </li>
